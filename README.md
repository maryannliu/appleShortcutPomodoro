# ⏱️ Pomodoro Shortcut

A customizable Pomodoro timer built with Apple Shortcuts. This shortcut helps you stay productive by guiding you through focused work sessions and short breaks—all while logging your progress to the Notes app.

## 🚀 Features
- ⏳ Customizable focus session length (default: 25 minutes)
- 🔁 Choose the number of sessions (default: 2)
- 🧘 5-minute breaks between sessions; 10-minute break after the final one
- 📝 Automatically logs your total focus time to the Notes app

## 🛠 Setup Instructions
Before using the shortcut:
1. Open the **Notes** app on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Create a new note titled exactly: `🍅 Pomodoro Log`
3. This note will be used to track your daily focus time automatically.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The shortcut asks how long you'd like to focus (default: 25 minutes).
2. Then, it asks how many sessions you'd like to complete (default: 2).
3. After each focus session, you get a 5-minute break.
4. After the final session, you get a 10-minute break.
5. Your total focused time is recorded in the 🍅 Pomodoro Log.

## 📱 Requirements
