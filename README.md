## 🧠 How It Works

1. Run the shortcut from the Shortcuts app or a widget.
2. The shortcut asks how long you'd like to focus (default: 25 minutes).
3. The shortcut asks how many sessions you'd like to complete (default: 2).
4. A focus timer starts — time to get to work!
5. When the timer ends, **return to the Shortcuts app**.
6. You'll see a prompt that says **"Start your break"** — tap OK.
7. A break timer starts (5 minutes for most, 10 minutes after the final session).
8. When the break ends, **return to the Shortcuts app** to begin the next round.
9. Steps 4–8 repeat until all sessions are completed.
10. Your total focused time is recorded in the `🍅 Pomodoro Log` note.


## 📱 Requirements
- iOS or iPadOS 15+
- Shortcuts app
- Notes app with a note titled `🍅 Pomodoro Log`


## ⚙️ Version Log 
- v1.1 - 2025.5.10: Remove text after finishing a complete pomodoro and click "No, thank you!" as it can not calculate total length of focus after more than one pomodoro.
